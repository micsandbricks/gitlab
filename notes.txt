Users in a git project can share data in a number of ways.
In this lab, we have chosen to create an online repository on github.com.
One of the users initialized the online rep., created a local folder, where they downloaded 
the files, and finally pushed those files to the online repository.

The other user then created a local repository, set their remote origin to the github url,
and pulled down the files from the repository. The other user could also have used the 
"git clone" command, along with the url, the get a full copy of the project along with
all history and configuration information.

"git pull" both fetches changes and merges them into the current branch of the user.
It is possible to only fetch the changes without merging. We tried this by having
Camilla add a comment to MyNode.java and pushing the changes to github. Martin then used the
following command:
"git fetch origin master"
followed by
"git log -p HEAD..FETCH_HEAD"
to first get the changes and then checking the difference in comparison with his local copy.
Martin also used the command
"gitk HEAD...FETCH_HEAD" 
to get a graphical interface that explains the differences between the reps. He then merged
Camillas changes:
"git merge origin master"
